Minimal [Cookiecutter] template for authoring [pytest] plugins that help
you to write better programs.

> This template requires [Cookiecutter 1.4.0 "Shortbread"][Shortbread] or
> higher

## Getting Started

Install [Cookiecutter] and generate a new pytest plugin project:

```no-highlight
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/saltastro/cookiecutter-pytest-salt-plugin
```

Cookiecutter prompts you for information regarding your plugin.

After you have answered all the questions, a directory structure for the plugin is created.
